    "+ As the gradient goes smaller and smaller as the algorithm progress down to the lower layer.\n",
    "+ As as result, the gradient descent updates leaves the lower layer connection weights virually unchanged.\n",
    "+ and the training never converges to a good solution.\n",
    "+ This problem is called Vanishing Gradient.\n",

    "+ Sometimes gradient can go bigger and bigger.\n",
    "+ and the Weights update will be very large.\n",
    "+ Then the algorithm will diverge.\n",
