    "# Look at the Big Picture - Frame the Problem.\n",
    "### TASK 1\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Use California Senses data to build a Model for Housing Prices in the State.\n",
    "+ Your Model should learn from this Housing Price Data.\n",
    "+ And should be able to Predict the median housing price in any District Given all other Metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FIRST IMPORTANT QUESTION\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The first Important Question to the Bussiness is\n",
    "+ What is the Exact Business Objective?\n",
    "+ How does the Compnay Expects to Benefit from the Model.\n",
    "+ By framing all these problem, you should be able to\n",
    "  + Select the Algorithms\n",
    "  + Select the Perfomance Measure.\n",
    "  + Select how to Evaluate the Model.\n",
    "  + How much efforts you will spend tweaking it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SOLUTION\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the model will be fed to another another ML system along with many other Signals. This downstream system will determine whether it is worth investing in a given area or not. Getting this right is critical, as it directly affects the revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "### PIPELINES\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Seqeunce of Data Processing Components.\n",
    "+ There will be a lot of Data Manipulation and Data Transformations will apply.\n",
    "+ These Components run Asynchronously.\n",
    "+ The Interface between components is Data Stores.\n",
    "+ This makes the System simple to Grasp. And different Teams can focus on Different Components.\n",
    "+ If one component is breaks, we can still run the system with stable data for a while.\n",
    "+ It will buy time to fix the bugs in broken components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SECOND IMPORATANT QUESTION\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the Current Solution that you are relying on, and What is the Perfomance of that System?\n",
    "SOLUTION\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It is manually calculated.\n",
    "+ The Results are 20% way off than we expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM IS IT\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It is a Supervised Learning Task, Since you are given a Labelled Data.\n",
    "+ It is a Regresssion Task, Since we have to Pedict some values.\n",
    "+ And it is a Batch Learning Task, Since there is no Continuous Incoming of Data, the Data will be fit in memory, and no need to Change data Rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SELECT A PERFOMANCE MEASURE\n",
    "\n",
    "+ For Regression TAsk, we use RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\n",
    "+ RMSE will give an Ideaof how much Error the System typically makes in the predictions.\n",
    "+ If there are Outliers Districts, then we can use MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n",
    "+ If the Output of the System is to be COnverted to Classes like Cheap, Medium or Expensive\n",
    "+ then It is a Classification Problem."
